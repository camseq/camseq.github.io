We are a group of PhD students and postdocs at the University of Cambridge.
With the help of the [Open Plant Fund](https://www.openplant.org/fund/)
we try to capture the microbial diversity in Cambridge using a portable DNA sequencer. Our team combines knowledge and know-­how from very different study backgrounds with the curiosity to learn about and share experiences on cutting-­edge portable DNA sequencing technology.
