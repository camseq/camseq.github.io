## PuntSeq
PuntSeq is a citizen science project led by a small [group of graduate students](https://puntseq.github.io/team) at the University of Cambridge, UK. Our aim is to monitor the quality and microbial diversity of freshwater of the river Cam and its nearby lakes by means of portable DNA sequencing, and to empower public stakeholders in using this technology for their own environmental assessment projects. Experiments will be conducted with Oxford Nanopore Technology's MinIONâ„¢ device, the world's first commercial hand-sized DNA sequencer, and results will be publicly shared through online resources and open access publishing. PuntSeq is funded by an OpenPlant grant of the joint efforts of the University of Cambridge, John Innes Centre Norwich, Earlham Institute Norwich, BBSRC and EPSRC.

PuntSeq is a Cambridge-based local initiative. Yet, water quality is a pressing issue of global importance. Our vision is that any citizen in the world has real-time access to biological water parameters in order to improve their health conditions. We therefore actively seek to share our research experiences with scientific experts, non-governmental organisations devoted to health care and environmental protection, and ultimately, the public. To follow our progress, comment on results, share your own inspirations and collaborate with us, just link yourself up with the project via twitter and our [PuntSeq account](https://twitter.com/puntseq).
